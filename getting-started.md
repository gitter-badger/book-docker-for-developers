# Getting Started

### Downloading and Installing Docker CE

Docker is available for a large number of desktop, server, and cloud platforms. It is packaged as a free [Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) \(**CE**\) and a commercially supported [Enterprise Edition](https://www.docker.com/enterprise-edition) \(**EE**\). There is a quarterly **stable** release for reliability and a monthly **edge** release that gives you access to the latest features.

For this course, we will use the **Community Edition**. It won't matter if you choose to install the latest stable or edge edition, which at the time of this writing are **18.03.1-ce** and **18.05.0-ce-rc1**, respectively. Docker's documentation doesn't always immediately reflect the latest version numbers, but you can always see the latest releases on [GitHub](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce/releases), if you're curious.

Unless you're planning to build Docker from source yourself, the recommended way to install Docker is from the [Docker Store](https://store.docker.com/). You can search for Docker at Docker Store, but the _Get started with Docker_ section is normally prominently displayed right on the home page anyway. The [link](https://store.docker.com/search?offering=community&type=edition) takes you to a page where you can choose the edition you want to use for your environment.

For this course, we will assume that you are using either [Docker Community Edition for Mac](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac) or [Docker Community Edition for Windows](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows). These are the best ways to work with Docker in a Mac or Windows system. The installation should be smooth and straightforward, especially for newer machines, but if you need documentation for installing, you can follow these links:

* [Install Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
* [Install Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
